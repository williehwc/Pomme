# Pomme

This fork of Pomme is intended to be used with [CroMagRallyWatch](https://github.com/williehwc/CroMagRallyWatch) or the software-rendered [CroMagRally](https://github.com/williehwc/CroMagRally) standalone SDL game. It is forked from [jorio/Pomme](https://github.com/jorio/Pomme), written by Iliyas Jorio.

This fork adds support for writing to float-based audio buffers used by AVFoundation on watchOS. This functionality does not affect running the standalone SDL game on macOS.
